### Reverse Get Password - An Extension Script for NZBGet

Renames the final destination directory to "title{{password}}" if a password was provided.

This might be usefull in some special usecases where having the password in the name of the destination folder might be desired.

__NOTE:__ If you have other post-processing scripts running, this extension script should probably be the last post-processing script to run

__NOTE:__ This script requires Python to be installed on the system running NZBGet.

See the [NZBGet documentation](https://nzbget.net/extension-scripts) for information on how to install extension scripts for NZBGet.
